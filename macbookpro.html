            <h2 class="headfont">Fourth generation</h2>
            <p class="parafont">Apple unveiled fourth generation 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models during a press event at their headquarters on October 27, 2016. All models, except the baseline 13-inch model, introduced the Touch Bar, a multi-touch enabled OLED strip built into the top of the keyboard in place of the function keys. The Touch Bar models also include a sapphire-glass covered Touch ID sensor at the right end of the Touch Bar which doubles as a power button. The models also introduce a "second-generation" butterfly mechanism keyboard that provided more travel than the first iteration implemented on the Retina MacBook. The 13-inch model has a trackpad that is 46% larger than its predecessor while the 15-inch model has a trackpad twice as large as the prior generation. All ports have been replaced with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals,[142] any of which can be used for charging.[143] The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals,[144][145] including Intel's own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices.[146] Furthermore, macOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them.[147] Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro.[143][148][149] The models come with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.

            <h2 class="headfont">Third generation</h2>
            <p class="parafont">On June 11, 2012 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, Apple introduced the third generation MacBook Pro, marketed as the "MacBook Pro with Retina display" to differentiate it from the predecessor model.[53] The new model includes Intel's third generation Core i7 processors (Ivy Bridge microarchitecture), USB 3.0, and a high-resolution 15.4" IPS 2880×1800-pixel Retina Display.[54] Other new or changed features include a second Thunderbolt port, a HDMI port, and a thinner MagSafe port, dubbed the "MagSafe 2".[100] Apple introduced a 13-inch version on October 23, 2012 with specifications similar but slightly inferior to the 15-inch version's, such as less powerful processors.[101]

                    The new models omit Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports, though Apple offers Thunderbolt adapters for both interfaces.[102] They also omit a SuperDrive, making the 15-inch model Apple's first professional notebook since the PowerBook 2400c to ship without a built-in optical drive.[103] Instead of a hard disk drive, the new models ship with a solid state drive housed in a proprietary flash module design rather than a 2.5" notebook drive. Apple also claims improved speakers and microphones and a new system for cooling the notebook with improved fans.[100] The new case design does not have a Kensington lock slot, so alternative products are required to physically secure the computer.[104]
                    
                    The Retina models also have fewer user-accessible upgrade or replacement options than previous MacBooks. Unlike in previous generations, the memory is soldered onto the logic board and is therefore not upgradable. The solid state drive is not soldered and can be replaced by users.[105] The battery is glued into place; attempts to remove it may destroy the battery and/or trackpad.[106] The entire case uses proprietary pentalobe screws and cannot be disassembled with standard tools. While the battery is glued in, recycling companies have stated that the design is only "mildly inconvenient" and does not hamper the recycling process.[107]
                    
                    On February 13, 2013, Apple announced updated prices and processors for the MacBook Pro with Retina Display and increased the RAM of the high-end 15-inch model to 16 GB.

            <h2 class="headfont">Second generation</h2>
            <p class="parafont">On October 14, 2008, in a press event at company headquarters, Apple officials announced a new 15-inch MacBook Pro featuring a "precision aluminum unibody enclosure" and tapered sides similar to those of the MacBook Air.[30][31] Designers shifted the MacBook Pro's ports to the left side of the case, and moved the optical disc drive slot from the front to the right side, similar to the MacBook. The new MacBook Pros had two video cards, which the user could switch between: the Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT with either 256 or 512 MB of dedicated memory and a GeForce 9400M with 256 MB of shared system memory.[30] Although the FireWire 400 port was removed, the FireWire 800 port was retained. The DVI port was replaced with a Mini DisplayPort receptacle.[30] The original unibody MacBook Pro came with a user-removable battery; Apple claimed five hours of use,[30] with one reviewer reporting results closer to four on a continuous video battery stress test.[32] Apple said that the battery would hold 80 percent of its charge after 300 recharges.

            <h2 class="headfont">First generation</h2>
            <p class="parafont">The original 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006 by Steve Jobs at the Macworld Conference & Expo.[4] The 17-inch model was unveiled on April 24, 2006.[5] The first design was largely a carryover from the PowerBook G4, but uses Intel Core CPUs instead of PowerPC G4 chips.[6] The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs the same as the 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, but is 0.1 inches (0.25 cm) deeper, 0.4 inches (1.0 cm) wider, and 0.1 inches (0.25 cm) thinner.[7] Other changes from the PowerBook include a built-in iSight webcam and the inclusion of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when yanked. These features were later brought over to the MacBook. The optical drive was reduced in size in order to fit into the slimmer MacBook Pro, hence it runs slower than the optical drive in the PowerBook G4 and cannot write to dual layer DVDs. Both the original 15- and 17-inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots found in the PowerBook G4. All first generation 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port,[9] while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports as well as one FireWire 400 port.[10] When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S-Video ports,[7][9] although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision[11] and is present in every version of the 17-inch design.[10] S-Video capability can be attained through the use of a DVI to S-Video adapter.[7] External displays with up to a 2,560 × 1,600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual-link DVI port.[12] All models include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g.[9][10] Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n[13] and Bluetooth 2.1.
