            <h2 class="headfont">iPhone X</h2>
            <p class="parafont">iPhone X ("X" pronounced "ten" /t…õn/)[9] is a smartphone designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It was announced on September 12, 2017, alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus. The phone was released on November 3, 2017. This device marks the iPhone series' tenth anniversary, with "X" being the symbol for "ten" in Roman numerals. The iPhone X is intended to showcase what Apple considers technology of the future, specifically adopting OLED screen technology for the first time in iPhone history, as well as using a glass and stainless-steel form factor, offering wireless charging, and removing the home button in favor of introducing Face ID, a new authentication method using advanced technologies to scan the user's face to unlock the device, as well as for the use of animated emojis called Animoji. The new, nearly bezel-less form factor marks a significant change to the iPhone user interaction, involving swipe-based gestures to navigate around the operating system rather than the typical home button used in every previous iteration of the iPhone lineup. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of US$999 also made it the most expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to additional local sales and import taxes.

The 5S introduced the A7 64-bit dual-core system-on-chip, the first 64-bit processor to be used on a smartphone, accompanied by the M7 "motion co-processor". A redesigned home button with Touch ID, a fingerprint recognition system which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate App Store and iTunes Store purchases, was introduced. The camera was also updated with a larger aperture and a dual-LED flash optimized for different color temperatures.            </p>

The iPhone 5C was available in several color options, and shipped with iOS 7. The iPhone 5C was sold at a discounted price point in comparison to the 5S: unlike Apple's prior practice of lowering the price of the previous model upon release of a new version, the iPhone 5 was explicitly discontinued and replaced by the 5C. On September 9, 2014, the 16 and 32 GB iPhone 5C models were replaced by the 8 GB model with the announcement of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. On September 9, 2015, the 8 GB version was discontinued when the iPhone 6S was announced.

The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple's A4 system-on-chip, along with iOS 4‚Äîwhich notably introduced multitasking functionality and Apple's new FaceTime video chat service. The iPhone 4 was also the first iPhone to include a front-facing camera, and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks, ending AT&T's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States.

This first generation iPhone was announced on January 9, 2007, after years of rumors and speculation. It was introduced in the United States on June 29, 2007, and it featured quad-band GSM cellular connectivity with GPRS and EDGE support for data transfer. On June 9, 2008, Apple announced its successor, the iPhone 3G. After this announcement, the first-generation iPhone became referred to by some sources as the iPhone 2G because it had become the last iPhone to ship with the old 2G-speed EDGE network. The original iPhone has not received software updates from Apple since iPhone OS (now iOS) 3.1.3. Since June 11, 2013, the original iPhone has been considered "obsolete" in Apple retail stores, "vintage" by other service providers in the US, and "obsolete" in all other regions.[10] Apple does not service vintage or obsolete products, and replacement parts for obsolete products are not available to service providers.
